# INLAbhmbasket

The goal of this package is to support practitioners in planning phase of basket trials under the Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling framework. 

The package provides tools for simulation of basket trials and computation of the operating characteristics under several choices of the prior on the arm-level variance (Gamma, Uniform, PC prior, half-t) and specification of the study (number of patients, cutoff probabilities, accrual rates, etc). 

INLAbhmbasket is joint work by Massimo Ventrucci and Alessandro Vagheggini.
